Database Migration is ensured by the Flyway database-migration tool
json parsing is possible by the Jackson library

# This was the Application I managed to build before the deadline.
## Unfortunately I couldn't fully implement and make the front-end functional 
## The backend project for the Hotel Reservation Management System is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, featuring controllers, entities, repositories, services, and utilities.
## Each component plays a crucial role in handling various aspects of the application, including managing hotels, rooms, reviews, bookings, and other functionalities.
## 
## The frontend contains only the desired design, populated with all the entities from the database.
## Next step would be to bring the changes from the backend and make sure the buttons work.
